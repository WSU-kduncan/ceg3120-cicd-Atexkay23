## Generating Tags

### How to See Tags in a Git Repository

You can view all tags in your repository using:

```bash
git tag
```

### How to Generate a Tag in a Git Repository

To create a tag, use this format:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
```

### How to push a tag in a git repository to GitHub
After creating a tag locally, push it to GitHub using:

```bash
git push origin v1.0.0
This will trigger workflows if they're configured to run on tag creation.


```
### Semantic Versioning Container Images with GitHub Actions

#### Summary of what your workflow does and when it does it

The workflow is triggered every time a new tag is pushed to the repository. It uses the tag to semantically version the Docker image, builds the image, and then pushes it to DockerHub with the correct version label.

#### Explanation of workflow steps

1. **Checkout Code** – Uses `actions/checkout` to get the code from the repository.
2. **Set Up Docker** – Initializes Docker so we can build and push images.
3. **Generate Metadata** – Uses `docker/metadata-action` to create version tags based on the Git tag.
4. **Log In to DockerHub** – Authenticates with DockerHub using secrets stored in the repo.
5. **Build and Push Image** – Builds the Docker image and pushes it to DockerHub using the generated tags.

#### Explanation / highlight of values that need updated if used in a different repository

- `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` – Update this secret with your DockerHub username.
- `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` – Update this secret with your DockerHub access token.
- `repository` in the metadata and build steps – Change this to match your DockerHub repo name.
- `tags` – These are auto-generated by the metadata-action, but should match your versioning format.

#### Changes in workflow

Compared to Project 4:
- This version adds a `on: push: tags:` trigger.
- It includes the `docker/metadata-action` to handle version labels.
- Docker build and push now use dynamic tags based on Git tag metadata.

#### Changes in repository

- GitHub secrets `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` and `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` must be added.
- A tag-based deployment strategy is used, instead of always deploying on push to main.
